# Reddit Redesign

A Chrome extension providing a _light_ redesign of Reddit, based primarily on the old theme. If you're running this, you'll want to **disable** the following options in your preferences:

- [ ] Allow subreddits to show me custom themes
- [ ] Use the redesign as my default experience

## Getting Started

I'll publish it eventually, but if you'd like to run it now, clone the repo and run the following:

```
npm install
gulp build
```

From there, follow the instructions for loading an unpacked extension in this [Getting Started Tutorial](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted)

## Development

If you'd like to build locally and make changes:

```
npm install
gulp
```

Gulp will compile the `/dist` directory and watch for changes.
